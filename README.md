# Password Generator
## About the Project
This Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

Here are the requirements:
- Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
  - Length of password: 
    - At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
  - Character types:
    - Lowercase
    - Uppercase
    - Numeric
    - Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)
- Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
- Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
